## 🔬 Mentorship Overview
This repository documents my journey through the Many Body Physics project. Each folder corresponds to a weekly assignment, focusing on simulating physical systems and analyzing phase transitions using Python.

## 📂 Project Index

### [Week 1: Percolation Theory](./Week1_Percolation)
- **Topic:** Site & Bond Percolation on 2D Square Lattices.
- **Key Algorithms:** Hoshen-Kopelman Algorithm
- **Results:** Verified phase transitions at $p_c \approx 0.59$ (Site) and $p_c \approx 0.50$ (Bond).

### Week 2: The Ising Model (Coming Soon)
